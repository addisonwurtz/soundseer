# Soundseer: 
By Addison Wurtz

***

## Description: 
Soundseer is a music visualizer. 

## Example Configurations 
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Dependencies
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Roadmap

- Beat detection visualizer + pyarcade radar sweet
- Keys to notes visualizer using colors for notes ... "raindrops" (pyarcare lights tutorial??)
- Pyarcade glow shader???
- Make a sidescrolling animation?
